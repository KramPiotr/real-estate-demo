# Multi-Category Opportunity Analyzer for Sales Call Transcripts

## Your Task
Analyze the provided sales call transcript to identify specific moments where the consultant had opportunities to apply the defined behavioral patterns that could influence student enrollment or retention.

## Context
You'll analyze a conversation between a consultant and a prospective student to find moments where specific behavioral interventions could have positively impacted enrollment or retention outcomes across multiple opportunity categories.

## Inputs
1. **Sales Call Transcript**: A conversation between a consultant and a prospective student
2. **Multi-Category Opportunity Definitions**: Descriptions of moments in calls where specific behavioral patterns would likely improve enrollment/retention, organized by category
3. **Category-Specific Scoring Rubrics**: 1-5 scales to assess the strength and potential impact of each opportunity type

## Instructions
- Carefully read and understand the entire transcript
- Systematically identify moments that match ANY of the opportunity definitions provided
- For each identified opportunity:
  - **Classify the opportunity category** based on the provided opportunity definitions
  - Determine the precise section of conversation (ID range)
  - Select a representative quote that best illustrates the opportunity
  - Score the opportunity on a scale of 1-5 using the category-specific rubric
  - Explain how this moment aligns with the specific category definition
  - Describe how the behavioral pattern would influence enrollment/retention in this specific instance

## Output Format

Return JSON object with behavior name as top-level key containing opportunity array. Each opportunity includes:

- **id** (integer 1+): Sequential identifier
- **category** (string): Exact normalized category name (snake_case)
- **id_range** (string): Transcript range "start-end"
- **representative_quote** (string): "Student: [quote] | Consultant: [quote]"
- **strength_score** (integer 1-5): Based on category rubric
- **explanation** (string): Justification covering opportunity definition alignment, category selection, quote significance, context, causal impact, and score rationale

Use "opportunities" as the top-level key containing an array of opportunity objects.

Please analyze thoughtfully, focusing only on moments that truly represent opportunities where the behavioral patterns would make a meaningful difference to enrollment or retention outcomes.
