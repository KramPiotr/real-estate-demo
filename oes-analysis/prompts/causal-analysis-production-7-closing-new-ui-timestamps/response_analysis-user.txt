## Effectiveness Assessment and Response Analysis (Layer 2)

You are an expert sales call analyst evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral patterns in educational sales calls.

**Context:** 
Online Education Services (OES) manages online education programs for multiple universities. Building on Layer 1's identification of pattern opportunities, your task is to analyze how effectively these opportunities were handled by evaluating student responses and consultant follow-up actions.

**Your Task:**
1. Verify the speaker identification from Layer 1
2. For each opportunity identified in Layer 1:
   - Locate the student's responses and consultant's follow-up actions in the transcript
   - Include at least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format in your analysis
   - Extract the average_behavioral_score from the llm_analysis_summary as your response_score
   - Add the appropriate tag (positive ≥ 4, negative ≤ 3, skip if between 3-4)
   - Focus ONLY on response effectiveness, not re-analyzing the opportunity context

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Include at least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format (student response and consultant follow-up)
- Reference specific pattern components and techniques from the definition
- Provide sufficient context for your analysis to stand independently
- Connect student responses to expected outcomes in the pattern definition

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "speaker_identification": {
    "student": "Speaker X",
    "consultant": "Speaker Y", 
    "evidence": "Evidence from Layer 1"
  },
  "pattern_name": {
    "component_name": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Opportunity title from Layer 1",
        "opportunity_score": 4.7,
        "response_score": 4.6,
        "tag": "positive",
        "opportunity": "Analysis from Layer 1 (preserved exactly)",
        "response": "Evidence-rich analysis including: (1) Student response quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format, (2) Consultant follow-up quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format, (3) Analysis of effectiveness based on these responses, (4) Connection to pattern components, and (5) Impact on enrollment journey."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important**: Your analysis must include comprehensive quotation of consultant responses directly from the transcript. Each point of analysis should be supported by direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format, naturally integrated within your analysis.

Be sure to examine the full transcript for consultant responses rather than relying solely on annotations, and capture language directly relevant to pattern response quality.

The behavioral pattern definition, annotated transcript with llm_analysis_summary, and Layer 1 output will be provided separately. Your analysis must conform strictly to the specific behavioral pattern provided and focus exclusively on response effectiveness.
