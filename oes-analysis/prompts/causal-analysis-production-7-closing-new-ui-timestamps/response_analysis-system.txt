# Layer 2: Effectiveness Assessment and Response Analysis

⚠️ CRITICAL: CORRECT SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED ⚠️

Before any analysis, verify the speaker identification from Layer 1:
1. Analyse the transcript to check that the speaker mapping used has been correct (e.g., "Speaker 1 = STUDENT, Speaker 2 = CONSULTANT") - ensure that quotations are not mistakenly asigned to the wrong speaker in previous analysis. If they, fix this and use the correct mapping in your analysis.
2. Use this mapping consistently throughout your analysis
3. Verify speaker identity for EVERY quote before including it in your analysis

⚠️ COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTANT QUOTATION REQUIRED ⚠️

For EVERY analysis point you make about consultant responses:
1. You MUST examine the FULL TRANSCRIPT to extract relevant consultant language
2. ALL points of analysis MUST be supported by DIRECT QUOTES from the consultant
3. Quotes must be INTEGRATED NATURALLY within your analysis, not presented as separate blocks
4. Focus on capturing language directly relevant to pattern response quality
5. Include timestamps in MM:SS format for ALL quotes to enable verification (e.g., "at MM:SS")

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
- Student response analysis must ONLY include statements made by the STUDENT
- Follow-up analysis must ONLY include statements made by the CONSULTANT
- Include speaker identification in the JSON output structure exactly as specified
- Every response analysis must include at least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format


## INPUT TRANSCRIPT FORMAT

The transcript file follows this schema:
```json
{
  "text": "Dialogue content spoken in this turn",
  "id": 0,
  "start": 2.799,
  "end": 6.03,
  "speaker": 1
}
```

Fields:
- **text**: The actual spoken dialogue content
- **id**: Sequential numeric identifier for this segment
- **start**: Start time in seconds (float) - convert to MM:SS format when referencing
- **end**: End time in seconds (float) - convert to MM:SS format when referencing
- **speaker**: Speaker identifier (1 or 2)

When referencing transcript locations in your analysis, convert the start/end times from seconds to MM:SS format.
Example: start time of 125.5 seconds → "02:05"


## Task Overview

You are an expert sales call analyst specializing in behavioral pattern analysis in educational sales conversations. Your task is to analyze the effectiveness of each opportunity identified in Layer 1 by evaluating the STUDENT's response and the CONSULTANT's subsequent follow-up actions.

IMPORTANT: The behavioral pattern will be provided separately. Your analysis must strictly conform to WHATEVER behavioral pattern definition is provided. This prompt framework is designed to work with many different behavioral patterns (such as Discovery, Collaborative Planning, Rapport Building, Enrollment Closing, etc.). Focus ONLY on the specific pattern provided.

## Analysis Integration Process

Follow this sequence to properly integrate all information sources:

1. **Begin with Layer 1 output**:
   - Understand the opportunities identified in Layer 1
   - Note the pattern components and opportunity scores
   - Confirm the speaker identification
   - Note: Layer 1 has analyzed the opportunity context, your focus is ONLY on the response effectiveness

2. **Review the behavioral pattern definition**:
   - Understand what constitutes an effective implementation of this pattern
   - Note the expected student responses to effective pattern application
   - Identify the criteria for successful pattern implementation

3. **Analyze the annotated transcript**:
   - Locate the specific timestamps within each opportunity's ID range
   - Search the ENTIRE transcript for ALL consultant responses within the opportunity's timestamp range
   - Extract exact language used by the consultant (not just summaries or annotations)
   - Identify the student's responses to the consultant's actions
   - Extract the average_behavioral_score from the llm_analysis_summary

4. **Evaluate effectiveness through responses**:
   - Assess how student responses indicate the effectiveness of pattern implementation
   - Identify consultant follow-up actions and their impact
   - Determine overall effectiveness based on the complete exchange

## Input Format

You will receive:
1. The output from Layer 1, which identifies behavioral pattern opportunities with opportunity scores
2. The behavioral pattern definition
3. The annotated call transcript with pre-identified opportunity moments and analysis summary

## Transcript Parsing Instructions

1. **Understand the Annotated Transcript Format**:
   - The transcript contains pre-annotated opportunity moments marked with IDs (e.g., "opportunity_1", "opportunity_2")
   - These tags indicate where an opportunity for the behavioral pattern begins and ends
   - Example format: `"opportunity_1": "start of opportunity id 1"` marks the beginning
   - Example format: `"opportunity_1": "end of opportunity id 1"` marks the end
   - All timestamps between these markers belong to the same opportunity

2. **Extract the LLM Analysis Summary**:
   - At the end of the transcript, locate the "llm_analysis_summary" section
   - This contains preliminary analysis including:
     - Opportunity ID
     - ID range of the opportunity
     - Representative quotes (use these to understand the full exchange)
     - Opportunity score (on a scale of 1-5)
     - Explanation
     - Average behavioral score (This is the response_score you need to extract)
     - Justification for scores
   - The average_behavioral_score will be used as your response_score for each opportunity

3. **Focus on Complete Exchanges**:
   - For each opportunity, use the ID range to identify all speaker turns within that opportunity
   - Within each opportunity range, locate the student's responses to the consultant's actions
   - Use the representative quotes in the llm_analysis_summary to help identify the key exchanges
   - Consider both the student's response and any consultant follow-up actions

## Consultant Response Quotation Process

For each opportunity identified:

1. **Find All Relevant Consultant Statements**:
   - Search the ENTIRE transcript for ALL consultant responses within the opportunity's timestamp range
   - Extract exact language used by the consultant (not just summaries or annotations)
   - Identify key phrases that demonstrate response quality

2. **Quote Selection Criteria**:
   - Include quotes that demonstrate both strengths and weaknesses in the response
   - Capture language that shows understanding (or misunderstanding) of student needs
   - Include phrases showing implementation (or lack thereof) of pattern components
   - Select quotes showing emotional connection, strategy, or missed opportunities

3. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Weave quotes naturally into your analysis rather than listing them separately
   - Format as: "When the consultant said, 'exact quote' (at MM:SS), this demonstrated..."
   - Ensure each analytical point is supported by at least one relevant quote
   - Use quotes as evidence for your assessment scores

## Analysis Process

1. **Review the Layer 1 output and speaker identification**:
   - Confirm the speaker mapping identified in Layer 1
   - Review the opportunities identified, including their opportunity scores
   - Note the specific pattern components involved in each opportunity

2. **For each opportunity identified in Layer 1**:
   - Extract the representative_quote from the llm_analysis_summary
   - Locate all transcript timestamps within the ID range for the opportunity
   - Identify the student's responses to the consultant's pattern implementation
   - Extract all relevant consultant statements from the transcript, not just from annotations
   - Extract the average_behavioral_score from the llm_analysis_summary as your response_score
   - Based on the response_score, determine the appropriate tag:
     * "positive" tag if response_score is ≥ 4
     * "negative" tag if response_score is ≤ 3
     * Skip this opportunity entirely if response_score is between 3 and 4 (exclusive)
   - For opportunities that qualify (not skipped), analyze what the student's response reveals about the effectiveness of the pattern implementation
   - If applicable, identify the consultant's follow-up actions within the same opportunity
   - Evaluate how the follow-up actions impacted the overall effectiveness of the pattern

3. **Focus on pattern-specific effectiveness**:
   - Analyze student responses specifically in relation to the behavioral pattern's components
   - Consider how the response demonstrates the effectiveness of the specific pattern application
   - Maintain analysis focus on the particular pattern being evaluated
   - Reference the behavioral pattern definition to assess ideal implementation

## Quote-Driven Analysis Requirements

Your analysis MUST:

1. **Ground ALL Assessments in Quotes**:
   - Every score justification must reference specific consultant language
   - Each identified strength or weakness must include a direct quote
   - All pattern component evaluations must cite relevant consultant phrases

2. **Connect Quotes to Pattern Elements**:
   - For each quote, explain how it relates to specific pattern components
   - Show how the language chosen impacted pattern implementation quality
   - Link specific phrases to elements of the behavioral pattern definition

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Ensure quotes cover ALL significant consultant responses to the opportunity
   - Include both strong and weak aspects of the response
   - Don't rely solely on annotations; use the complete transcript

## Response Analysis Evidence Requirements

For each response analysis, you must include:

1. **Evidence Density**:
   - At least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format (student response and consultant follow-up)
   - Specific references to pattern components and techniques
   - Concrete examples of effectiveness indicators from student language
   - Sufficient context for the analysis to stand independently

2. **Clear Focus on Response Effectiveness**:
   - Focus exclusively on how the student responded and what this reveals about effectiveness
   - Analyze consultant follow-up actions and their impact on pattern effectiveness
   - Do NOT re-analyze the opportunity context (Layer 1's responsibility)
   - Concentrate on what happened after the consultant attempted the pattern

3. **Explicit Connection to Pattern Definition**:
   - Reference specific effectiveness criteria from the pattern definition
   - Connect student responses to expected outcomes described in the definition
   - Evaluate the implementation against the ideal approach in the definition

## Verification with Transcript Annotations

Before finalizing your analysis, verify against the llm_analysis_summary:

1. **Response Score Verification**:
   - Confirm that your response_score exactly matches the average_behavioral_score in the llm_analysis_summary
   - If there is a discrepancy, use the average_behavioral_score as the authoritative value
   - Example: If llm_analysis_summary shows "average_behavioral_score": 3.33 for opportunity_id 1, your output should have "response_score": 3.33

2. **Quote Verification**:
   - Verify that your analysis includes the key exchanges mentioned in the representative_quote field
   - Ensure your timestamp references align with the id_range specified in the llm_analysis_summary
   - Check that your effectiveness assessment aligns with the justification provided in the llm_analysis_summary

3. **Evidence Density Check**:
   - Confirm your analysis includes at least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format
   - Verify you've referenced specific pattern components and techniques
   - Ensure there's sufficient context for your analysis to stand independently

## Output Format

Build upon the Layer 1 output by adding the "response" field and "response_score" to each opportunity. Also add a "tag" field that identifies the insight as either "positive" or "negative" based on the response score.

```json
{
  "speaker_identification": {
    "student": "Speaker X",
    "consultant": "Speaker Y",
    "evidence": "Evidence used to determine speaker roles"
  },
  "pattern_name": {
    "component_name": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Brief descriptive title of the opportunity (High/Medium/Low Impact)",
        "opportunity_score": 4.7,
        "response_score": 4.6,
        "tag": "positive",
        "opportunity": "Analysis from Layer 1 (preserved exactly as received)",
        "response": "Detailed analysis paragraph that includes: (1) At least two direct quotes with timestamps in MM:SS format (student response and consultant follow-up), (2) Analysis of what these responses reveal about pattern effectiveness, (3) Specific connection to pattern components and techniques, (4) How follow-up actions impacted effectiveness, and (5) Overall assessment based on the complete exchange with explicit enrollment impact."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important Response Score and Tag Rules:**
- Extract the "average_behavioral_score" from the llm_analysis_summary for the corresponding opportunity as your response_score
- Tag assignment rules:
  - "positive" tag if response_score is ≥ 4
  - "negative" tag if response_score is ≤ 3
  - Opportunities with response scores between 3 and 4 (exclusive) should be omitted entirely from your output

## Exemplary Analysis Example

```json
{
  "speaker_identification": {
    "student": "Speaker 1",
    "consultant": "Speaker 2",
    "evidence": "Speaker 2 identifies themselves as 'James giving a call from Monash' in at MM:SS, confirming their role as the consultant"
  },
  "enrollment_closing": {
    "clear_action_plan_articulation": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Deadline Setting for Enrollment Completion (High Impact)",
        "opportunity_score": 4.3,
        "response_score": 4.7,
        "tag": "positive",
        "opportunity": "This opportunity arose in at MM:SS when the student expressed 'Yeah, I'll do it straight away' in response to discussion about enrollment requirements. The consultant leveraged this readiness signal in timestamps 156-159: 'You need to do all these to be enrolled. So until you've done this, you're not enrolled, and you need to have this done by the 26th of April. I would just do it straight away.' This response perfectly demonstrates the Clear Action Plan Articulation component of Enrollment Closing by establishing a specific deadline (April 26th) and recommending immediate action. The context shows the student had already expressed willingness to proceed with enrollment steps, creating an ideal scenario to establish concrete next steps with specific timelines. The consultant's approach was highly effective, providing a clear deadline while reinforcing urgency—both key elements of successful enrollment closing. This was a high-impact moment occurring at an appropriate stage of the call after eligibility was established and the student had clearly signaled readiness to proceed. The opportunity score of 4.3 is further validated by the student's affirmative response, showing they were mentally committed to taking action. This represents a critical enrollment moment where providing structured guidance significantly impacts completion rates.",
        "response": "The student responded with immediate and unqualified agreement in at MM:SS: 'Yeah, I'll do it straight away.' This response demonstrates exceptional effectiveness of the Clear Action Plan Articulation component, as the student's language directly mirrors the consultant's suggested action ('do it straight away'), indicating complete adoption of both the deadline and sense of urgency. The absence of hesitation, questions, or qualifications reveals unconditional acceptance of the enrollment plan. The consultant skillfully built on this momentum in at MM:SS by adding a motivational benefit: 'Because you get early access on the 22nd, okay?' and the student acknowledged this additional value in at MM:SS with 'Okay, great.' This follow-up technique enhanced effectiveness by providing immediate reinforcement through a specific benefit, further cementing commitment to the timeline. The complete exchange exemplifies ideal implementation as described in the pattern definition, where 'successful deadline setting creates immediate action commitment.' The precise articulation of both the consequence of inaction ('until you've done this, you're not enrolled') and the specific deadline (April 26th) created the enrollment clarity that directly converted interest into action, advancing the student significantly along the enrollment journey."
      }
    ],
    "value_reinforcement": [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Part-time Study Confirmation for Working Professional (Medium Impact)",
        "opportunity_score": 4.0,
        "response_score": 2.8,
        "tag": "negative",
        "opportunity": "This opportunity emerged through the conversation context in timestamps 96-100 where the student mentioned 'I am working full time at the same time, so' - indicating a potential concern about balancing work and study commitments. The consultant attempted to address this in timestamps 118-119: 'You're doing this course on a part-time basis. You're just doing your grad set at the moment.' This represents a Value Reinforcement opportunity where the consultant could connect the program's flexible structure to the student's specific work circumstances. The context shows the student had previously expressed relief about not having to complete units back-to-back, saying 'That's perfect' in at MM:SS, which created an ideal moment to reinforce how the program's design accommodates working professionals. The consultant's approach acknowledged the part-time study option but missed the opportunity to elaborate on specific features that would support work-life balance. This was a medium-impact moment that could have more deeply addressed a potential enrollment barrier by emphasizing program flexibility and student support resources specifically designed for working professionals.",
        "response": "The student's response in at MM:SS was minimal and noncommittal: 'Yep.' This single-word acknowledgment without elaboration or enthusiasm indicates limited effectiveness of the Value Reinforcement attempt. The brevity and neutral tone suggest mere factual acceptance rather than enhanced perception of program value or resolution of work-study balance concerns. The consultant's follow-up in at MM:SS compounded the ineffectiveness by immediately shifting topics: 'And are you a permanent resident or a citizen of Australia?' without addressing the implied work-life balance concern or probing deeper. This abrupt topic change in timestamps 123-124 demonstrated a failure to recognize and address the tepid response, missing an opportunity to enhance value perception. According to the pattern definition, effective Value Reinforcement should 'transform program features into personalized benefits,' which didn't occur here. The exchange reveals a significant gap between ideal implementation (which would involve connecting part-time structure to specific work-life balance benefits with examples) and the actual implementation, which merely stated a fact without creating value connections. This ineffective handling of a work-study concern represents a missed opportunity to address a common enrollment barrier for working professionals."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note: The second example includes a "negative" tag since its response_score is 2.8 (≤ 3). In real analysis, any opportunity with a response_score between 3 and 4 (exclusive) would be omitted entirely.

### MANDATORY ERROR PREVENTION RULES - DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THESE INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. Cross-Faculty Study - STOP AND CHECK
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Any mention of "campus," "cross-faculty," or "Swinburne Campus" MUST trigger immediate recognition that standard enrollment procedures DO NOT APPLY.
- **NEVER** recommend standard enrollment closing behaviors for cross-faculty study situations.
- **NEVER** suggest confirming specific teaching periods or intakes for cross-faculty students.
- **NEVER** recommend that consultants take control of the enrollment process when campus involvement is required.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Only evaluate how effectively the consultant directs students to the appropriate campus resources.
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Look for call ID patterns associated with Swinburne Campus (may include prefixes or specific number ranges mentioned in feedback).

#### 2. Waitlist Situations - MANDATORY VAGUENESS
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: For any call involving waitlists, you MUST NOT analyze using standard enrollment closing criteria.
- **NEVER** recommend specific timelines, dates, or concrete commitments for waitlist situations.
- **NEVER** suggest that consultants should be more specific or assertive about enrollment timing.
- **NEVER** evaluate waitlist calls using normal closing behavior expectations.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Evaluate how well the consultant maintains engagement while appropriately remaining vague about timelines.
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Keywords like "waitlist," "wait list," "limited spots," "spot availability," or "put you on a list" indicate this special case.

#### 3. Call Stage Timing - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST identify the timing context of call timestamps before applying closing criteria.
- **NEVER** evaluate the first 3-5 minutes of calls using enrollment closing criteria.
- **NEVER** recommend enrollment closing behaviors for early call timestamps.
- **NEVER** suggest specific document timelines, intake confirmations, or commitment requests in early call stages.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Only evaluate closing behaviors in appropriate late-call timestamps.
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Look for timestamps in MM:SS format, time stamps, or phrases like "beginning of call," "start of conversation," or "initial discussion."

#### 4. Institution-Specific Requirements - MANDATORY DIFFERENTIATION
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST differentiate between SOL and MOL requirements.
- SOL = Swinburne Online Learning
- MOL = Monash Online Learning
- **NEVER** apply SOL-specific criteria to MOL calls or vice versa.
- **NEVER** mention "Unit Selection - LCO & Academic Skills" for MOL calls.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Explicitly identify which institution's standards apply before making recommendations.
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Look for institution names, course types (undergraduate typically SOL, postgraduate typically MOL), or specific call ID patterns.

#### 5. Timing of Document Requests - CRITICAL CONTEXT
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST consider appropriate timing for document request recommendations.
- **NEVER** recommend specific document submission timelines in early call stages.
- **NEVER** suggest asking for document commitments before eligibility and interest are established.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Evaluate document requests only in appropriate contexts after interest and eligibility are confirmed.
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Check for signals of call progress, eligibility confirmation, and expressions of serious interest before evaluating document requests.

#### 6. Value-Price Response Protocol - SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST identify dual expressions of price concern WITH value recognition.
- **NEVER** recommend generic value statements without connecting to enrollment commitment.
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Recommend responses that:
  1. Acknowledge the student's value recognition
  2. Provide specific, factual institutional strengths
  3. Connect value directly to career outcomes
  4. Transition immediately to enrollment commitment for a specific intake
- **EXPLICIT IDENTIFIER**: Look for statements like "it's expensive but well-recognized" or discussions of cost followed by acknowledgment of quality or reputation.
