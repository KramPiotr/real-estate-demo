**Description:** Consultant demonstrates behavior of using previously gathered information about the student's background, goals, and preferences to guide planning discussions without repetitive questioning.

**Identification Guidance:** Look for consultants who reference earlier conversation elements when initiating planning discussions and build on established context rather than starting from scratch.

### 16.A.ii: Adaptive Collaboration Style
**Description:** Consultant demonstrates behavior of adjusting the level of directiveness versus collaboration based on the student's demonstrated communication preferences and decision-making style.

**Identification Guidance:** Look for consultants who present multiple viable options while connecting each to the student's specific circumstances and objectives.
