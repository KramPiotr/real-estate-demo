# TAXONOMY ARTIFACT 3: SALES CONSULTANT BEHAVIORS

This taxonomy examines sales consultant approaches that may influence student progression through enrollment gates.

## 3.A: Pressure Tactics & Misaligned Incentives

### 3.A.i: Artificial Urgency Creation
**Description**: Consultant creates false time pressure or uses scarcity tactics to push for immediate enrollment.

**Identification Guidance**: Look for statements suggesting limited spots, imminent deadlines, or other time pressures that may not be accurate or relevant.

**Examples**:

- Consultant: "I'd hate for you to miss out if you wait too long to decide"
- Consultant creates arbitrary deadlines: "I need your decision by tomorrow"

### 3.A.ii: Objection Dismissal/Minimization
**Description**: Consultant quickly dismisses or minimizes legitimate student concerns rather than addressing them substantively.

**Identification Guidance**: Note instances where student concerns are downplayed, redirected, or dismissed without adequate exploration or resolution.

**Examples**:

- Consultant changes the subject when student raises concerns
- Consultant provides generic reassurance without addressing the specific concern

### 3.A.iii: Excessive Promise-Making
**Description**: Consultant makes unrealistic promises about outcomes, support, or the student experience that exceed what the institution can deliver.

**Examples**:
- Consultant: "This degree virtually guarantees you'll get a promotion"

- Consultant makes specific salary increase promises without evidence

## 3.B: Student-Centered Approaches

### 3.B.i: Comprehensive Needs Assessment

- Consultant honestly discusses workload demands when asked
- Consultant explains both the benefits and limitations of support services

### 3.B.iii: Fit-Based Recommendation
