<behavior_essence>
Empathy is about putting oneself in the student's shoes and demonstrating a genuine understanding of their situation. The consultant expresses this understanding through supportive statements and by sharing relevant information about how the university addresses common concerns. This creates a connection with the student and shows that their feelings are respected and considered.
