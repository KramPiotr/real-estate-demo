<behavior_name>Objection Handling</behavior_name>

Effectively addressing student concerns or hesitations by acknowledging the concern, providing information or solutions, and checking if the student is satisfied with the response. This approach demonstrates responsiveness to student needs and helps overcome potential barriers to enrollment.

<behavior_essence>
Objection handling is about transforming potential obstacles into opportunities for deeper engagement. The consultant listens carefully to identify the underlying concerns, addresses them directly with relevant information or solutions, and ensures that the student feels heard and satisfied. This process not only resolves immediate issues but also builds trust and confidence in the institution's ability to support the student.
