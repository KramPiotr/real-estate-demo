<behavior_essence>
Adaptability is about being flexible and responsive to the unique needs of each student. The consultant demonstrates this by actively assessing the student's communication style, level of knowledge, and emotional state, then tailoring their approach to best suit the situation. This personalized approach helps create a more comfortable and productive interaction, leading to better outcomes for both the student and the institution.
