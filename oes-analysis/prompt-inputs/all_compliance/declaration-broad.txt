Student Declaration
Definition: Consultants must confirm that the student has received and agreed to the student declaration (or terms and conditions) during enrollment calls. This ensures that students understand and accept the terms and conditions of their enrollment.

Indicative phrases:

"Student Declaration -- Confirmed as emailed, read, and agreed upon."

Examples of common paraphrasing:

'Have you received the student declaration/terms and conditions email? It's important that you read and agree to the terms before we proceed.'
'I'll send you the student declaration/terms and conditions now. Once you've had a chance to review it, please confirm that you agree to the terms.'
'The student declaration/terms and conditions outlines your rights and responsibilities as a student. Please let me know when you've read and agreed to it.'
