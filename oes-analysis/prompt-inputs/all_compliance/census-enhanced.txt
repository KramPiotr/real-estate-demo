# Census Date Information

## Conceptual Overview
The census date is a critical milestone with significant financial and academic implications for students. Consultants should communicate key information to:
- Help students understand their rights and obligations
- Support informed decision-making about academic commitments
- Prevent potential penalties due to lack of awareness
- Demonstrate transparency and support for students

## Essential Composite Requirements

### 1. Clear Definition and Significance (Importance: Essential)
- Provide a clear, concise definition of the census date
- Explain the significance of this date in the context of the student's enrollment
- Emphasize the importance of being aware of and acting before this date if necessary

### 2. Implications and Options Explanation (Importance: Essential)
- Explain the academic implications, including transcript records

Note: LLMs should assess whether the consultant has made a reasonable effort to cover these key points about the census date, without requiring exact phrasing or exhaustive detail.
