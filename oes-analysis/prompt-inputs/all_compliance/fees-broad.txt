HECS-HELP and Fee-Help Explanation

Essence:
The consultant should briefly mention the availability of government loan schemes like HECS-HELP and other fee-help options for domestic students. The explanation should be simple and tailored to the student's level of interest.

Indicative phrasing:
"As a domestic student, you might be eligible for government loan schemes like HECS-HELP, which can help you defer your tuition fees. Would you like me to explain a bit more about how that works?"

If the student shows interest, the consultant can add: "Basically, it means you don't have to pay your fees upfront. You'll only start repaying the loan once you're earning above a certain amount, and it's done through the tax system."
The consultant should be ready to provide more details or direct the student to additional resources if asked.
