# Enrollment Closing Opportunity Framework: Comprehensive Definition with Examples

## Core Definition

An Enrollment Closing Opportunity occurs when a student demonstrates readiness to move forward in the enrollment process through direct or indirect signals, and the call has progressed sufficiently through the discovery and value-building phases to warrant securing commitment for specific next steps.

These opportunities enable consultants to establish mutual accountability, confirm concrete action steps with explicit timelines, schedule specific follow-up interactions, and maintain enrollment momentum.

## The 5-Part Framework for Enrollment Closing Opportunities

The framework consists of five distinct types of enrollment closing opportunities. Each represents a critical moment in the consultation where the consultant can secure commitment and advance the student's enrollment journey:

1. **Teaching Period Confirmation**
2. **Clear Action Plan Articulation**
3. **Documentation Submission Process Clarity**
4. **Mutual Commitment Establishment**
5. **Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling**

All other topics (including value proposition discussions, work-study balance concerns, etc.) fall outside this scope and should be analyzed under different behavioral patterns such as objection handling or collaborative planning.

## Critical Identification Guidelines

When identifying enrollment closing opportunities:

- **Call Stage**: Only identify opportunities after the call has progressed beyond initial discovery (typically 5-7 minutes in)
- **Context Validation**: Verify eligibility and program fit have been established and major objections addressed
- **Student Signals**: Look specifically for readiness indicators through verbal and contextual cues 
- **Objective Scoring**: Score opportunities based on their inherent potential if handled optimally (not on consultant's actual response)
- **Institutional Context**: Never identify closing opportunities in special cases (cross-faculty study, waitlist situations)

## Score 5 Opportunities

All examples below represent "Score 5" opportunities—critical, high-priority moments where enrollment closing would have maximum impact. These should always be identified and scored as 5, regardless of how the consultant actually responded.

## 1. Teaching Period Confirmation Opportunities

**Definition**: When a student has expressed interest in a program and the call context allows for confirming a specific intake date or teaching period.

A Score 5 Teaching Period Confirmation opportunity meets these criteria:
- Student has demonstrated clear interest in the program
- Call has progressed well beyond discovery phase
- Major objections have been addressed
- Value has been established for the program
- Discussion has naturally progressed to timing considerations

### Subtypes of Teaching Period Confirmation (All Score 5)

#### A. Direct Proposal with Student Acceptance

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625209404141  
> **Consultant**: Michael Bosman  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity emerges when the consultant states, "Okay, so we're looking to start the Graduate Diploma of Psychology in TP4, which will be our June intake, June 30th. Is that alright with you?" and the student responds, "Yep, perfect." This demonstrates a key Teaching Period Confirmation opportunity aligned with the definition criteria where call progression allowed for confirming a specific intake date. The student's agreement signals readiness for enrollment, making this moment crucial for anchoring interest into a concrete commitment. Successfully leveraging this opportunity would greatly enhance enrollment likelihood by transforming expressed interest into confirmed participation.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student directly accepts a specific proposed intake date ("Yep, perfect")
- Consultant explicitly names the teaching period and exact start date ("June intake, June 30th")
- Call has progressed to where eligibility and program interest are established
- The interaction is at the optimal point to anchor the student's commitment to a concrete timeline

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Look for moments when the student asks about or responds positively to specific start dates. Watch for questions like "When does the program start?" or statements acknowledging timeline readiness. These signals indicate the student is mentally preparing for a specific enrollment period, creating the perfect moment to confirm and secure commitment to a teaching period.

#### B. Assertive Enrollment Securing

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 624835167037  
> **Consultant**: Michael Kiag  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> The student acknowledged this commitment with "Okay." (segment 23), showing readiness to proceed with the July intake. This indicates clear acceptance of the teaching period confirmation and represents a pivotal enrollment moment. The consultant effectively closed the enrollment timeline by emphasizing, "I can actually secure your place of study with us in July" (segment 20). This assertive language helped solidify the student's decision, ensuring they were aligned with the upcoming intake. The straightforward confirmation of the teaching period significantly aided in converting interest into definitive action, aligning perfectly with the behavioral pattern's objective of transforming interest into commitment through clear timelines.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Consultant uses definitive, action-oriented language ("I can actually secure your place")
- Student acknowledges with simple agreement ("Okay")
- The consultant takes control through confident language that presupposes commitment
- The call has progressed to where value has been established and objections addressed

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Look for moments when the student has shown consistent interest throughout the call, any major objections have been addressed, and the consultation is nearing conclusion. These are prime moments to use assertive language to secure commitment to a specific teaching period. The opportunity is strongest when the student has already indicated general interest in proceeding with enrollment.

#### C. Student-Initiated Timing Question

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 624835545865  
> **Consultant**: Michael Bosman  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity arose when the student explicitly asked, "Does it matter when you start? Is there like a particular time that I need to start?" This directly indicates student readiness to commit to a specific intake period. This aligns with the behavioral pattern's requirement for student readiness signals, particularly their inquiry about start dates, indicating they're prepared for concrete enrollment planning. The consultant's response provided specific intake details, "So our next intake is starting on the 30th of June, but we have an intake every two months after that." This creates an ideal moment to confirm a specific teaching period, significantly enhancing enrollment likelihood by anchoring the student's intent around a specific start date. The timing here is appropriate as the major concern about funding had been addressed earlier, making this a perfect step to advance the enrollment process.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student directly asks about timing ("Does it matter when you start?")
- The question reveals readiness to consider specific enrollment periods
- It occurs after addressing key concerns (funding was previously discussed)
- The student's language shows they're mentally preparing for enrollment

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Watch for direct student questions about timing, start dates, or application deadlines. These questions indicate the student is mentally shifting from general interest to specific timeline planning. These moments are ideal for confirming a specific teaching period, especially when they occur after addressing major concerns and building program value.

#### D. Psychological Readiness Expression

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 624458224263  
> **Consultant**: Nicholas Bowers  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This high-value opportunity is evident in segment 64, where the student indicates a decision-making readiness by expressing that they now have the "time and headspace" to proceed with enrollment. This aligns perfectly with the criteria for Teaching Period Confirmation opportunities, as it follows various discussions on program suitability and eligibility. The consultant's introduction of the July intake timing in segment 73 lends the conversation an ideal moment to confirm a concrete enrollment date. Specifically, the student states, "So yeah, that's why I sort of reached back out," signaling their proactive engagement and interest in moving forward, which correlates with readiness for enrollment anchoring. The dialogue transitions from a renewed interest to planning action steps, thereby emphasizing the strategic importance of timing for starting studies. This aligns with the definition's component of anchoring decisions around a concrete start date, ultimately facilitating enrollment conversion. The contextual progression from the initial consultation stages to discussing intake periods marks the call progression as ready for closing actions.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student expresses a cognitive/emotional shift ("time and headspace now")
- Student proactively reinitiates contact ("reached back out")
- Conversation follows program discussions and has established eligibility
- The psychological language reveals internal decision-making progress

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Watch for student language that reveals mental/emotional shifts toward readiness. Phrases like "I'm ready to move forward," "I've been thinking about this," or mentions of having "time" or "capacity" now signal psychological preparation for enrollment. These moments are particularly valuable when they follow a previous period of consideration, indicating the student has mentally progressed toward commitment.

#### E. Clarification-Based Confirmation

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625206626477  
> **Consultant**: Mrudang Pancholi  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> In this situation, where the student expressed confusion about the intake timing, the consultant's statement "Now we are enrolling for the July intake" provided necessary clarification but lacked the assertiveness needed to capitalize on the opportunity to confirm the teaching period. A more effective response would have been, "Great, let's go ahead and secure your spot for the July 7th intake. This way, you'll have everything lined up for your start—does that sound good to you?" Such language not only confirms the next available intake but also creates a sense of urgency and action, which could have leveraged the student's expressed interest into a commitment. By immediately suggesting they reserve their spot, the consultant would help anchor the student's decision-making around a specific date, significantly increasing the likelihood of enrollment. In future interactions with students showing readiness, integrating assertive and clear strategic prompts can enhance commitment levels by establishing a definitive starting point, thereby strengthening enrollment momentum.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student expresses confusion about intake timing
- Consultant provides factual information but without assertive closing
- The moment occurs after program interest has been established
- There's an opportunity to transform informational response into commitment

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Watch for student statements or questions that reveal information gaps about timing or intake periods. These moments offer a perfect opening to not only provide factual information but to immediately transition into securing commitment. The strongest opportunities occur when the student is seeking timeline clarification, signaling they're mentally preparing for enrollment but need confirmation of details before committing.

## 2. Clear Action Plan Articulation Opportunities

**Definition**: When a student has expressed interest in proceeding and needs specific guidance on application next steps.

A Score 5 Clear Action Plan Articulation opportunity meets these criteria:
- Student has indicated they want to move forward with application
- The conversation has reached a point where concrete next steps can be outlined
- Student appears ready for specific guidance on processes/requirements
- The call has progressed through discovery and value-building phases
- Primary concerns about program suitability have been addressed

### Example 1: Deadline Emphasis with Consequences

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625293285389  
> **Consultant**: Luke Williams  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This high-impact opportunity emerged when the consultant emphasized deadlines: "Now you will need to set up your Monash account before the 21st of June and you need to select your units before the 22nd of June. If that's not done, both of those things are not done, you are unenrolled from your course." (Segments 218-221) This relates to the Documentation Submission Process Clarity component, where the consultant highlighted the urgency of document submission to maintain enrollment, providing clear, actionable deadlines. This moment is significant as it addresses a potential barrier to enrollment by establishing firm timelines, propelling the student to act decisively. The assertive and directive communication style underscores the importance of the task, maintaining enrollment momentum.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Specific dates and deadlines are referenced ("21st of June" and "22nd of June")
- Clear consequences for inaction are outlined ("you are unenrolled from your course")
- Directive language creates urgency and clarity
- Multiple specific action steps are detailed in sequence
- The communication occurs at a critical point in the enrollment process

### Example 2: Application Interest with Document Request

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 624835229132  
> **Consultant**: Michael Kiag  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This moment serves as a clear Documentation Submission Process Opportunity. The student's concern about prerequisites ('Or is there something else required prior to being able to do that course?') opens a path for outlining documentation needs. The consultant's response ('I would need that Cert IV and a copy of your resume') clearly addresses eligibility, aligning with standard enrollment scenarios. By detailing these submission requirements during this exchange, the consultant sets a clear path towards enrollment, which effectively alleviates uncertainties about the process. Such clarity fosters readiness for enrollment by replacing vague eligibility concerns with tangible requirements, effectively removing barriers that impede progression.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student directly asks about prerequisites or requirements
- The conversation has progressed beyond discovery to specific enrollment steps
- The context allows for articulating specific documentation needs
- Student's question signals readiness to understand concrete action steps
- The exchange creates a natural opening to detail clear enrollment path

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Look for moments when the enrollment process requires the student to complete multiple specific actions. These high-value opportunities typically occur after program interest and eligibility have been established, as the conversation transitions to administrative requirements. The strongest opportunities arise when the student needs structured guidance with concrete deadlines to navigate the enrollment process efficiently, particularly when there are time-sensitive actions required.

## 3. Documentation Submission Process Clarity Opportunities

**Definition**: When a student needs clarity on documentation requirements and submission timelines to proceed with enrollment.

A Score 5 Documentation Submission Process Clarity opportunity meets these criteria:
- The conversation has established program interest and eligibility
- Call has progressed to the point of discussing enrollment logistics
- Student appears receptive to specific document submission instructions
- Precise document requirements are relevant to advancing enrollment
- Clear submission timelines would maintain enrollment momentum

### Example 1: Email-Based Document Submission

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625301571869  
> **Consultant**: Gabriel Almeida  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity arises when the student agrees to receive information via email, which provides an opening to clarify the document submission requirements for enrollment. The consultant provides explicit instructions: "But all you need to do is to reply to my e-mail with your official academic transcript from your bachelor's degree." This aligns with the 'Documentation Submission Process Clarity' component, transitioning interest into tangible steps toward enrollment by ensuring continued progress and engagement. Utilizing assertive language in specifying urgency or timelines could further strengthen this opportunity. Such clarity is essential for fostering enrollment progress by providing specific document requirements and submission methods.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student agrees to receive information via email
- Consultant provides specific document requirements ("official academic transcript")
- Exchange follows earlier program interest discussions
- Specific document type is named rather than general "send your documents"

### Example 2: Document Verification with Timeline

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 624980460489  
> **Consultant**: Pawan Thapa  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity arose when the student expressed having already applied and sent their papers, stating: "I enrolled on Friday, I think it was, like last week." (segment 73). This directly aligns with the Clear Action Plan Articulation criteria because the student has shown readiness to move forward in the process and is seeking confirmation of their enrollment status. The consultant can seize this moment to confirm receipt of documentation and provide specific next steps, further capitalizing on the student's momentum. This is significant as it transitions the student's interest into actionable progress towards enrollment, essential for maintaining the application trajectory. The preceding conversation about the program details and the student's proactive documentation submission established a foundation for a clear action plan.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student references previous document submission
- Student seeks confirmation of enrollment status
- The conversation timing allows for verification and next steps clarification
- Student has demonstrated proactive engagement through prior document submission
- The exchange creates a natural opening to outline remaining enrollment requirements

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Look for moments when the conversation naturally transitions to next steps after program interest has been established. Watch for student questions about process or documentation, or consultant transitions to administrative details. These moments allow for specific document requests that create clear action paths. Strongest opportunities occur when the student has already demonstrated program interest and is ready for concrete next steps.

## 4. Mutual Commitment Establishment Opportunities

**Definition**: When call conditions allow for creating explicit agreement on both student and consultant responsibilities with clear timelines.

A Score 5 Mutual Commitment Establishment opportunity meets these criteria:
- The call has established strong program interest and eligibility
- Student has indicated willingness to take specific actions
- The conversation naturally allows for defining mutual responsibilities
- Establishing reciprocal commitments would significantly enhance enrollment likelihood
- Clear timelines and accountability points can be established

### Example 1: Enrollment Letter Confirmation

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625035764398  
> **Consultant**: Gabriel Almeida  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity is captured when the consultant informs the student, "For now, I will send you the letter fall for very soon to your name in the next five minutes confirming your place in the course." (Segment 175) The student responds with "Yeah awesome thank you so much," (Segment 180) showing receptiveness and agreement. This aligns with the Mutual Commitment Establishment criteria, as it reassures the student of their enrollment and sets expectations for upcoming steps. While the consultant provides enrollment confirmation, a more detailed discussion on mutual responsibilities could enhance the commitment. The opportunity is significant as it solidifies both parties' roles, strengthening the progression towards program initiation and enhancing retention likelihood.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Consultant commits to a specific action with timeline ("in the next five minutes")
- Student shows positive acknowledgment and receptiveness
- The exchange creates clarity about next steps in the enrollment process
- The moment allows for establishing mutual expectations and responsibilities
- The call has progressed to a point where solidifying commitments is appropriate

### Example 2: Document Submission Agreement Request

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625206740154  
> **Consultant**: Mrudang Pancholi  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity arose from the student's inquiry: "So what's the due date for the application for the next semester?" This signal demonstrates a readiness to proceed given further guidance, matched by the consultant's response: "Today's about just confirming your sport. So if you want, we can still proceed. You will have all the time." Establishing explicit student and consultant responsibilities with clear timelines presents a Mutual Commitment Establishment opportunity. This opportunity aligns by facilitating accountability and engagement for the enrollment process's next steps. Creating explicit agreements about responsibilities and timelines here would enhance continued process engagement. Both student and consultant established their roles but lacked definitive mutual commitments with specified dates/times, which reduced urgency. Stronger phrasing and definitive timelines could have maximized this opportunity for securing closure on mutual commitments.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student directly asks about application deadlines
- The question signals readiness to understand timeline commitments
- Consultant acknowledges the purpose of confirming enrollment ("confirming your sport")
- The exchange allows for establishing clear roles and responsibilities
- The conversation has reached a point where mutual commitments would advance enrollment

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Watch for moments when the enrollment process requires coordination between student and consultant actions. Look for student questions about process flow or indications they want to understand "what happens next" after they take specific actions. These opportunities are strongest when clearly defining both parties' responsibilities would create accountability and structure that facilitates enrollment progression.

## 5. Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling Opportunities

**Definition**: When conditions allow for establishing specific dates, times, and methods for follow-up interactions that maintain enrollment momentum.

A Score 5 Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling opportunity meets these criteria:
- Student shows interest but may need time to consider or gather information
- The call has established program value and addressed major concerns
- Student signals openness to continued engagement
- Setting a specific follow-up would create accountability and prevent momentum loss
- The conversation reaches a natural point for scheduling next interaction

### Example 1: Post-Enrollment Application Follow-Up

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625206769531  
> **Consultant**: Michael Bosman  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> This opportunity occurred when the consultant asked, "Would you be looking to study this this year or any time if you were going to pursue it?" (Segment 259) and the student responded affirmatively, "I think so, yes." (Segment 260). This interaction generates a strong opportunity for proactive follow-up scheduling, as it aligns with student readiness signals and institutional context suitability criteria. The significance rests within establishing a timeline for action and securing a mutual commitment, thereby enhancing enrollment likelihood. This timing is optimal, occurring after the foundational consultation phases, ensuring student engagement is crystallized around a clear course of action. The opportunity is noted with a 4.7 score, signaling high potential impact due to indicated student readiness.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student indicates positive interest in studying ("I think so, yes")
- Consultant directly asks about timeline intentions
- The conversation has established program interest and suitability
- The exchange creates a natural opening to schedule a specific follow-up
- The timing occurs after consultation phases but before securing final commitment

### Example 2: Application Interest with Document Follow-Up

**Perfect Example**:
> **Call ID**: 625292986713  
> **Consultant**: Mrudang Pancholi  
> 
> **Opportunity Analysis**:  
> The STUDENT's response, "If that's the case, then I'd be keen to put forward an application. Are there still places that are available?" (segment 51), clearly indicates a willingness to move forward. However, the CONSULTANT's subsequent response, "July intake is fine. We still have places available and yeah, you're not commencing until the 30th of June..." (segment 62), lacked assertive closing language, such as "Let's secure your spot now for the July intake". While the information was useful, it did not fully capitalize on the STUDENT's interest to create momentum towards enrollment. The CONSULTANT should have focused on securing a commitment immediately. This response missed an opportunity to use assertive closing techniques recommended for high-value opportunities according to the specified behavioral patterns.

**Key Identifiers**:
- Student explicitly expresses interest in applying ("keen to put forward an application")
- Student directly asks about availability, indicating readiness
- The conversation has established program understanding and interest
- The exchange creates a perfect opening to schedule specific follow-up actions
- The timing is optimal for securing commitment and scheduling next steps

**How to Identify Similar Opportunities**:
Look for moments when the call is concluding without immediate enrollment commitment, yet the student shows continued interest. Watch for phrases like "I'll get back to you" or "Let me check a few things" which signal the need for a specific follow-up schedule. These opportunities are strongest when the timing of the next interaction is left open-ended, creating a risk of momentum loss that could be prevented through scheduling.

## Comprehensive Scoring Rubric (1-5)

### 5 - Critical Opportunity (Highest Priority)
- **Definition**: A perfect opportunity for enrollment closing representing the highest possible impact on enrollment likelihood
- **Student Signals**: Student has explicitly expressed readiness to proceed or has asked direct questions about enrollment timing/process
- **Call Timing**: Occurs after thorough discovery, value-building, and objection handling
- **Context**: All necessary prerequisites for enrollment commitment have been addressed
- **Missed Impact**: Failure to capitalize would significantly reduce enrollment likelihood
- **Examples**: Student directly asking about intake dates; student expressly stating readiness to proceed; student proactively reinitiated contact after considering options

### 4 - Strong Opportunity
- **Definition**: A high-value opportunity for enrollment closing with substantial impact on enrollment likelihood
- **Student Signals**: Student has shown clear interest and implied readiness through questions or statements
- **Call Timing**: Occurs well after discovery phase with value clearly established
- **Context**: Major objections have been addressed, though minor concerns may remain
- **Missed Impact**: Failure to capitalize would moderately reduce enrollment likelihood
- **Examples**: Student showing positive response to program information; student asking about application processes; student expressing alignment between program and goals

### 3 - Moderate Opportunity
- **Definition**: A viable opportunity for enrollment closing with potential impact on enrollment likelihood
- **Student Signals**: Student shows interest but may have ambiguous commitment signals
- **Call Timing**: Occurs after basic discovery with some value established
- **Context**: Some objections addressed but others may need attention
- **Missed Impact**: Failure to capitalize would somewhat reduce enrollment chances
- **Examples**: Student showing general interest; student asking exploratory questions about process; student indicating potential future action

### 2 - Limited Opportunity
- **Definition**: A minimal opportunity for enrollment closing with limited impact on enrollment likelihood
- **Student Signals**: Student shows initial interest but with significant hesitation
- **Call Timing**: May occur early in consultation with limited value-building
- **Context**: Several objections remain unaddressed or program fit is uncertain
- **Missed Impact**: Failure to capitalize has minimal impact on enrollment outlook
- **Examples**: Student in early exploration phase; student with multiple lingering concerns; student giving mixed signals about readiness

### 1 - Minimal Opportunity
- **Definition**: A technically valid but extremely weak opportunity for enrollment closing
- **Student Signals**: Student shows only passing interest with clear hesitation
- **Call Timing**: Typically occurs early in consultation with minimal value-building
- **Context**: Major aspects of program fit or value remain unestablished
- **Missed Impact**: Failure to capitalize has negligible impact on enrollment likelihood
- **Examples**: Student still asking basic information questions; student expressing significant uncertainty; student giving clear signals of early research phase

## Critical Guidance: Identification vs. Scoring

**IMPORTANT**: Only closing opportunities that fit within one of the 5 types (Teaching Period Confirmation, Clear Action Plan Articulation, Documentation Submission Process Clarity, Mutual Commitment Establishment, Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling) should be identified - even when they are not ideal Score 5 opportunities.

All valid opportunities should be identified and scored according to this rubric, regardless of:
- How effectively the consultant actually responded
- Whether the opportunity seems "weak" or "strong"
- The consultant's personal closing style or approach

Opportunities scored 1-4 are still legitimate closing opportunities if they fit one of the 5 types. For example:
- A Teaching Period Confirmation opportunity where the student shows mild interest in program timing might score 2-3
- A Documentation Submission Process opportunity where program fit is still being established might score 2
- A Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling opportunity early in the consultation might score 1-2

Out-of-scope scenarios like value proposition discussions, work-study balance concerns, waitlist situations, or cross-faculty study contexts should NOT be identified as enrollment closing opportunities regardless of scoring potential.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing the identification and scoring of any enrollment closing opportunity, verify:

1. **Type Alignment**: Does this opportunity clearly fit one of the 5 defined types?
2. **Call Stage**: Has the call progressed beyond initial discovery (5-7 minutes)?
3. **Student Signals**: Has the student demonstrated some level of interest or readiness?
4. **Contextual Appropriateness**: Is this a standard enrollment scenario (not cross-faculty or waitlist)?
5. **Scope Adherence**: Does this focus on enrollment closing rather than objection handling or other patterns?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," the opportunity should not be identified. If all are "yes," identify the opportunity and assign the appropriate score using the 1-5 rubric above.

## Conclusion

By consistently applying this framework to identify and score enrollment closing opportunities, consultants can recognize the optimal moments to secure commitment and advance the student's enrollment journey. Remember that all legitimate opportunities within the 5 types should be identified and scored appropriately, even when not "perfect" Score 5 opportunities.
