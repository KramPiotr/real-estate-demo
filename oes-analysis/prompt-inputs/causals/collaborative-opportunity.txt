## Causal Impact Logic

<causal_impact_logic>
Collaborative Planning directly improves enrollment and retention likelihood by:

1. **Creating Ownership**: When students participate in creating their educational plan, they develop a sense of ownership that increases commitment to follow through with enrollment and persist through challenges.

2. **Aligning Expectations**: Collaborative discussions ensure students have realistic expectations about workload, progression, and outcomes, preventing future disappointment that could lead to dropout.

3. **Building Confidence**: Guided decision-making builds student confidence in their educational choices, reducing decision anxiety that can prevent enrollment completion.

4. **Personalizing the Educational Journey**: Plans tailored to individual circumstances demonstrate the institution's commitment to student success beyond enrollment.

5. **Proactively Addressing Constraints**: Identifying and planning around potential obstacles preemptively reduces future dropout risk when those challenges arise.

6. **Strengthening Relationship**: The collaborative nature of the planning process strengthens the consultant-student relationship, creating comfort and trust that supports enrollment decisions.

## Good Opportunity Examples

<good_examples>
### Example 1: Career Transition Planning (Strength: 5)
Student: "I'm currently in IT support but want to move into cybersecurity management. I have a family and work full-time, so I'm concerned about how I'll balance everything. I'm also wondering which specialization would give me the best chance at making this career change. There are so many options, and I don't want to waste time or money on the wrong path."

*Why this is a critical opportunity*: The student presents a complex situation involving career transition, multiple life constraints, and significant uncertainty about educational direction. They're explicitly seeking guidance while clearly wanting to be involved in the decision-making process. The stakes are high as this decision will impact their career trajectory and family life.

### Example 2: Unit Selection Uncertainty (Strength: 3)
Student: "I'm interested in the Business Analytics program, but I'm not sure which units to take in my first semester. I haven't studied for several years, so I'm a bit nervous about jumping in too deep. What would you recommend for someone in my situation?"

*Why this is a moderate opportunity*: The student clearly expresses uncertainty about unit selection and has mentioned relevant contextual information (study gap). They're explicitly seeking recommendations while showing readiness to engage in the planning process. This represents a good opportunity for collaborative planning, though with more limited scope than Example 1.

### Example 3: Competing Program Options (Strength: 4)
Student: "I'm torn between the Masters in Finance and the MBA with Finance specialization. My company might sponsor me, but they want to see how either program would directly benefit my current role in corporate finance. I need to make a strong case for whichever program I choose."

*Why this is a strong opportunity*: The student is deciding between two significant program options with external stakeholder considerations (employer). There's a need to align educational choices with specific professional outcomes, creating a complex decision-making scenario ideal for collaborative approach.

### Example 4: Work-Study Integration Planning (Strength: 4)
Student: "I work rotating shifts at the hospital, not sure how I'll manage study."

*Why this is a strong opportunity*: The student has identified a specific work-related barrier to enrollment that requires collaborative planning to address. By working together to develop strategies for balancing their specific work situation with study requirements, the consultant can transform a potential barrier into a manageable challenge, significantly increasing enrollment likelihood. The complexity of rotating shift work creates a need for personalized solutions.

### Example 5: Redundancy Situation (Strength: 4)
Student: [Has expressed concerns about managing study after recent redundancy]

*Why this is a strong opportunity*: The student is concerned about balancing study commitments with their changing work situation (recent redundancy). This creates an opportunity to collaborate on how the program's flexibility features could specifically support them during this transition period, addressing a potential enrollment barrier. The uncertainty around their future employment situation requires adaptable planning.

### Example 6: Caring Responsibilities (Strength: 4)
Student: "I have caring responsibilities for an elderly parent - how flexible is the program?"

*Why this is a strong opportunity*: The student has identified a specific personal circumstance that could impact their ability to engage with the program. This creates an opportunity to collaboratively develop study approaches that accommodate their caring responsibilities, demonstrating how the program can adapt to their unique situation rather than requiring them to fully adapt to the program.

### Example 7: Industry-Specific Challenge (Strength: 4)
Student: "My work involves frequent travel - how can I stay on track with the course?"

*Why this is a strong opportunity*: The student has mentioned a specific work pattern (frequent travel) that creates a potential barrier to consistent study. This allows for collaborative planning to address this unique challenge, exploring program features that accommodate irregular access to study resources and developing strategies tailored to the student's travel patterns.
</good_examples>

## Bad Opportunity Examples (False Positives)

<bad_examples>
### Example 1: Simple Information Request
Student: "When does the next teaching period start?"

*Why this is NOT a collaborative planning opportunity*: The student is simply requesting factual information rather than seeking guidance on decision-making or expressing uncertainty about their educational journey. This is a straightforward information exchange.

### Example 2: Already Decided Student
Student: "I've decided I want to enroll in the Master of Education program. What documents do I need to submit for my application?"

*Why this is NOT a collaborative planning opportunity*: The student has already made their key educational decision and is now focused on procedural next steps. They're not expressing uncertainty or seeking guidance about their educational pathway.

### Example 3: General Curiosity Question
Student: "How many students typically enroll in this program each year?"

*Why this is NOT a collaborative planning opportunity*: This question reflects general curiosity about the program rather than a desire to engage in planning or decision-making about the student's own educational journey.

### Example 4: Simple Administrative Question
Student: "Can I get an extension on the application deadline?"

*Why this is NOT a collaborative planning opportunity*: This question is focused on an administrative process rather than educational planning or decision-making. It does not involve uncertainty about educational pathways or require collaborative exploration of options.

## Implementation Principles for Personalized Solutions

<implementation_principles>
When addressing opportunities for collaborative planning that involve personalized solutions, consultants should:

1. **Engage in true collaborative planning** rather than providing one-way advice
2. **Ask specific questions** about the student's unique circumstances
3. **Reference similar students** who have successfully managed comparable situations
4. **Co-create potential solutions** rather than prescribing them
5. **Provide specific, detailed examples** rather than generic reassurances
6. **Tailor examples** to the student's specific industry or situation
7. **Explain exactly how program features** address their specific concerns
8. **Check for agreement** with direct questions about potential approaches
9. **Use "we" language** to emphasize collaborative problem-solving
10. **Connect program flexibility** directly to the student's current life situation
</implementation_principles>

## Important Note on Opportunity Identification

<important_note>
The opportunity score reflects the potential impact if collaborative planning is ideally facilitated, not the consultant's actual response quality. Even if a consultant fails to engage in effective collaborative planning, the opportunity should still be identified and scored based on the student's expressed needs and the complexity of the educational decisions at hand. The opportunity strength rating measures how impactful proper collaborative planning would be in that specific scenario, regardless of whether the opportunity was successfully leveraged.
