# Enrollment Closing Behavioral Response Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SCOPE GUIDANCE

**Focus ONLY on these key enrollment closing elements:**
1. Teaching Period Confirmation
2. Clear Action Plan Articulation
3. Documentation Submission Process Clarity
4. Mutual Commitment Establishment
5. Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling and clear next steps

Value proposition discussions, work-study balance concerns, and other topics outside this scope should be analyzed under different behavioral patterns (objection handling, collaborative planning, etc.).

## Conceptual Definition

Enrollment Closing is a strategic consultative behavior focused on creating a clear, actionable roadmap for prospective students through the application process while securing commitment for a specific teaching period. The behavior involves establishing mutual accountability, confirming concrete next steps with explicit timelines, scheduling specific follow-up interactions, and maintaining enrollment momentum.

Effective Enrollment Closing transforms student interest into concrete commitment by providing structure, clarity, and urgency while respecting the natural progression of the consultation process.

## Documentation Request Language Guidance

Based on client feedback, the following language guidelines should be applied:

### AVOID phrases like:
- "Are you ready to start the process with the necessary documents today?"

### PREFERRED approach examples:
- "If you can get those documents to me today, we get the process started and your spot secured."
- "Great, to get the ball rolling, when do you think you can get your documents/certificates to me by?"

### For financial aid discussions:
- Rather than asking "Is that the option you are thinking?", use social proof and specific deadline requests
- Example: "Yes, Fee-Help is available as an Australian citizen and the majority of University students go for this option. Great, to get the ball rolling, when do you think you can get your documents/certificates to me by?"

## Teaching Period Confirmation Language

Client feedback indicates more assertive language is preferred:

### AVOID:
- "Shall we go ahead and reserve your spot now to ensure you're ready for the May intake?"

### PREFERRED:
- "Let's go ahead and secure your spot now so you're ready for the May intake...how does that sound?"

## Key Components (Updated with Client Feedback)

### 1. Teaching Period Confirmation (Essential)

**Definition**: Securing explicit agreement on a specific teaching period with clear start dates to establish a concrete enrollment target.

**Effective Implementation Example**:
```
Consultant: "For the second teaching period which will be starting from the 7th of July."
Student: "So how do I do the just take to the application like get in and everything?"

Enhanced approach based on client feedback: "Let's go ahead and secure your spot for the July 7th intake... how does that sound?"
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- Use specific dates rather than vague references to teaching periods
- Use more assertive language than previously recommended
- Avoid asking if they "would like to" or using "shall we" phrasing
- Present the enrollment action as the natural next step
- Directly connect teaching period confirmation to specific action
- Check for agreement with direct questions requiring clear responses

**Enrollment/Retention Impact**: Confirming a specific teaching period establishes a concrete target date that focuses all subsequent enrollment actions, creating a psychological anchor that significantly increases enrollment likelihood. The precise date also helps set accurate expectations for program commencement, supporting long-term satisfaction.

### 2. Clear Action Plan Articulation (Essential)

**Definition**: Outlining specific, sequential steps in the enrollment process with concrete deadlines and purpose explanations for each step.

**Effective Implementation Example**:
```
Consultant: "To start your journey towards the graduate diploma, we need to confirm your eligibility and review your transcripts. Let's set a timeline: can you submit the necessary documents by next Friday?"
Student: "Okay, that sounds good."

Enhanced approach based on client feedback: "Great, here's how we'll move forward: First, I need your transcript and proof of citizenship by Friday. Once I receive those, I'll process your application immediately to secure your spot for the May intake. How does that timeline work for you?"
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- Structure information in numbered or sequential steps
- Provide specific deadlines for each action item
- Use concrete language that creates clear expectations
- Include both student actions and consultant commitments
- Focus on when documents will be submitted rather than if they will be submitted
- Present the action plan as the natural progression rather than an option

**Enrollment/Retention Impact**: Well-structured action plans eliminate confusion about next steps, which is one of the primary causes of enrollment abandonment. The concrete timelines create urgency and accountability, while purpose explanations build motivation by connecting actions to the student's enrollment goals.

### 3. Documentation Submission Process Clarity (Essential)

**Definition**: Specifying exactly which documents are needed, by when, for what purpose, and how they should be submitted, with clear deadlines that create momentum.

**Effective Implementation Example**:
```
Consultant: "Send him a copy of your transcript and just proof of citizenship... And then we could potentially go from there."
Student: "Sure, sure."

Enhanced approach based on client feedback: "If you can get your transcript and proof of citizenship to me today, we get the process started and your spot secured. When do you think you can get those to me by?"
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- Explicitly list each required document
- Use assertive language that assumes document submission will happen
- Focus on timing ("when") rather than willingness ("are you ready")
- Create appropriate urgency without unnecessary pressure
- Connect document submission to securing their place
- Use social proof where appropriate (especially for financial aid options)

**Enrollment/Retention Impact**: Clear documentation requirements with specific deadlines significantly improve document submission rates, which directly impacts application completion. Explaining the purpose of documents helps students prioritize submission and understand the value of completing this sometimes challenging step.

### 4. Mutual Commitment Establishment (Essential)

**Definition**: Creating explicit agreement on both student and consultant responsibilities with clear timelines, ensuring both parties understand their roles in the enrollment process.

**Effective Implementation Example**:
```
Consultant: "I'll touch base with you in two weeks just to see how things are and if you're looking to go forward we can then discuss the next steps."
Student: "Okay, cool. Thank you."

Enhanced approach based on client feedback: "I'll call you next Friday at 2pm to confirm we've received your documents and to finalize your enrollment. By that time, I'll have your application pre-processed so we can complete the enrollment during that call. Does that time work for you?"
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- Clearly state what the consultant will do and by when
- Clearly state what the student should do and by when
- Use assertive language that assumes progress will continue
- Provide specific dates and times for follow-up interactions
- Create accountability through clear expectations
- Confirm agreement to these specific commitments

**Enrollment/Retention Impact**: Mutual commitment establishment significantly improves follow-through rates by creating clear expectations and accountability. The specific commitments from both parties ensure the enrollment process doesn't stall due to uncertainty about next steps or responsibilities, directly impacting application completion rates.

### 5. Proactive Follow-Up Scheduling (Essential)

**Definition**: Establishing specific dates, times, and methods for follow-up interactions that maintain enrollment momentum and provide ongoing support.

**Effective Implementation Example**:
```
Consultant: "What I can do on my end then, I can send you two emails."
Student: "Yeah, that would be great."

Enhanced approach based on client feedback: "I'll send you the document requirements email today, and then call you on Friday at 3pm to answer any questions and help finalize your document submission. Would earlier or later on Friday work better for you?"
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- Specify exact dates and times for follow-up interactions
- Explain the purpose of each scheduled follow-up
- Ask about timing preferences rather than if they want a follow-up
- Ensure follow-up timing aligns with document submission expectations
- Present follow-up as a natural part of the process, not an option
- Create a sense of ongoing support and guidance

**Enrollment/Retention Impact**: Specific follow-up scheduling dramatically reduces application abandonment by creating accountability checkpoints. These scheduled interactions prevent students from "falling through the cracks" during the enrollment process and provide opportunities to address emerging concerns before they become enrollment barriers.

## Out-of-Scope Behaviors (Do Not Analyze These)

Based on client feedback, the following are outside the scope of enrollment closing and should be analyzed under other behavioral patterns:

### 1. Value Proposition Reinforcement

**Example seen in client feedback**:
```
Student concerns about cost: "That's a little bit way beyond our budget."
Response included: "Our graduates benefit from exclusive industry partnerships which significantly boost their career prospects..."
```

**Why this is out of scope**: This involves reinforcing the program's value to address objections about cost. This should be analyzed under the "Objection Handling" behavioral pattern, not Enrollment Closing.

### 2. Personalized Work-Study Solutions

**Example seen in client feedback**:
```
Student concerns about managing study after redundancy.
Response included: "With your current flexibility, you can take advantage of our interactive sessions after hours. Some students in similar situations plan their studies around new job searches."
```

**Why this is out of scope**: This involves creating personalized study solutions for specific work circumstances. This should be analyzed under the "Collaborative Planning" behavioral pattern, not Enrollment Closing.

## Behavioral Scoring Rubric (1-5)

### 5 - Exceptional Implementation
- Uses assertive language for teaching period confirmation ("Let's go ahead and secure your spot...")
- Provides comprehensive, sequential action plan with specific deadlines
- Specifies exactly which documents are needed with clear submission timelines
- Establishes explicit mutual commitments with precise dates and times
- Schedules specific follow-up with clear purpose and timing
- Uses client-preferred language for document requests and teaching period confirmation
- Avoids phrases like "Are you ready to start the process with the necessary documents today?"
- For financial aid discussions, uses social proof ("majority of students choose this option")

### 4 - Strong Implementation
- Uses somewhat assertive language for teaching period confirmation
- Provides clear action plan with general timeframes
- Specifies required documents with some submission guidance
- Establishes mutual commitments with general timing
- Schedules follow-up with approximate timing
- Uses mostly appropriate language for document requests
- May occasionally use less assertive phrasing
- May lack some specificity in timelines or commitments

### 3 - Competent Implementation
- Confirms teaching period but without strong commitment language
- Provides basic next steps without comprehensive sequencing
- Mentions required documents but with limited submission guidance
- Establishes some mutual commitments but lacks precision
- Schedules general follow-up without specific dates/times
- Uses a mix of assertive and non-assertive language
- May use some less effective phrasing like "would you like to" or "shall we"
- Financial aid discussions lack social proof elements

### 2 - Basic Implementation
- Mentions teaching period without confirmation attempt
- Provides vague next steps without clear timeline
- Lists documents without submission guidance or deadlines
- Offers limited commitment on consultant's part
- Mentions follow-up without scheduling
- Uses primarily passive or non-assertive language
- Regularly uses less effective phrases like "are you ready to..."
- Does not connect document submission to securing spot

### 1 - Minimal Implementation
- Fails to confirm teaching period
- Provides no clear next steps or action plan
- Mentions documents without specificity or purpose
- Establishes no mutual commitments
- No follow-up scheduling
- Uses exclusively passive language
- Consistently uses ineffective phrases
- No sense of urgency or momentum created

## Implementation Context Sensitivity

Effective Enrollment Closing must be adapted to specific contexts:

### 1. Call Timing Considerations
- **Appropriate Timing**: Only implement Enrollment Closing after sufficient discovery, need analysis, and value building (typically in the latter portion of calls)
- **Premature Application**: NEVER apply closing techniques in the first 3-5 minutes of a call
- **Readiness Signals**: Look for student questions about process, acknowledgment of value, or expressions of interest as signals to initiate closing
- **Value Foundation**: Ensure sufficient value has been established before attempting to secure enrollment commitments

### 2. Special Context Adaptations
- **Cross-Faculty Study**: For cross-faculty studies, focus on appropriate campus referral rather than standard enrollment closing
- **Waitlist Situations**: Maintain deliberate vagueness with waitlist students rather than providing specific commitments
- **Early Exploration Stage**: For students in early exploration, focus on information provision and follow-up rather than immediate enrollment closing
- **Institutional Differences**: Adjust closing approaches for different institutions (SOL vs. MOL) with their specific requirements

## Examples of Effective Implementation Based on Client Feedback

### Example 1: Document Submission with Fee-Help Discussion

```
Context: Student has asked about payment options as an Australian citizen
Consultant: "Yes, Fee-Help is available for all Australian citizens, which is the option the majority of our students choose. To get that set up, I need your citizenship documentation. To get the ball rolling, when do you think you can get your documents to me by?"

Student: "Probably by next week."

Consultant: "If you can get them to me by Tuesday, we can have everything processed before the early enrollment deadline on Friday. I'll send you the Fee-Help form today, and I'll call you on Tuesday at 2pm to confirm receipt. Does that time work for you?"
```

**Why this is effective according to client feedback**: This incorporates the client's feedback on using social proof ("majority of students choose") and directly asks about document submission timing rather than readiness to proceed. It avoids using the phrase "Are you ready to start the process with the necessary documents today?" and instead focuses on "when" the documents can be provided.

### Example 2: Teaching Period Confirmation with Direct Commitment

```
Context: Student has asked about program start dates
Consultant: "The program starts on July 7th. Let's go ahead and secure your spot now so you're ready for the July intake. I just need your transcript and ID to get started. How does that sound?"

Student: "That works for me."

Consultant: "Great! If you can get those documents to me by Friday, we can finalize your enrollment next week. When do you think you can send those over?"
```

**Why this is effective according to client feedback**: This uses the client's preferred assertive language for teaching period confirmation ("Let's go ahead and secure your spot") rather than the less effective "Shall we go ahead and reserve your spot." It moves directly from confirming the date to securing commitment without asking if they "would like to" enroll.

## Implementation Principles Based on Client Feedback

1. **Use Assertive Language**
   - Replace "Shall we..." with "Let's go ahead and..."
   - Replace "Would you like to..." with direct statements assuming action
   - Present enrollment actions as the natural next step rather than an option

2. **Focus on When, Not If**
   - Ask "When do you think you can get your documents to me by?" rather than "Are you ready to start the process?"
   - Assume the student will submit documents and focus on timing rather than willingness
   - Create a sense that enrollment is progressing rather than still being decided

3. **Use Social Proof for Financial Options**
   - Mention "the majority of University students go for this option" when discussing Fee-Help
   - Create normative expectations that can influence decision-making
   - Make the student feel their choice is validated by what others typically do

4. **Connect Document Submission to Securing Spots**
   - Explicitly link timely document submission to securing their place in the program
   - Create appropriate urgency without unnecessary pressure
   - Help students understand the concrete benefits of prompt action

5. **Provide Specific Follow-Up Commitments**
   - Offer exact dates and times for follow-up interactions
   - Explain precisely what will happen during these follow-ups
   - Create accountability through clear expectations
