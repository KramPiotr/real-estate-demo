# Negative Buyer Signals - Behavioral Definition

## Purpose
Identify and score negative signals that indicate barriers to purchase or reduced likelihood to buy.

---

## 1. Financial Barriers (`financial_barriers`)

### Definition
Buyer indicates financial constraints, uncertainty, or obstacles that may prevent purchase.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Mentions credit issues, denied loans, or financing challenges
- [ ] Budget significantly below property price without awareness
- [ ] Job instability, income uncertainty, or pending financial changes

### Scoring Rubric (Severity)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Cannot qualify for financing, no savings, recent bankruptcy or foreclosure |
| 4 | Pre-approval denied or unlikely, significant budget gap, job loss pending |
| 3 | Financing uncertain, budget tight, some financial concerns expressed |
| 2 | Minor budget concerns, waiting on one financial element to clear |
| 1 | No financial barriers detected |

### Strong Negative Examples
> **Score 5**: "We had a foreclosure three years ago and we're still rebuilding our credit. We're not sure if anyone will lend to us."

> **Score 4**: "I'm being laid off next month but we're hoping to get approved before that happens."

### Moderate Negative Examples
> **Score 3**: "Our budget is around $400k but everything we like is $500k+. We're not sure how to bridge that gap."

## 2. Decision Paralysis (`decision_paralysis`)

### Definition
Buyer shows inability or unwillingness to make decisions, chronic indecisiveness, or endless comparison.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Has been looking for extended period (6+ months) without making offers
- [ ] Expresses inability to decide, needs to see "more options"
- [ ] Revisits same concerns repeatedly without resolution

### Scoring Rubric (Severity)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Looking for 1+ year, never made offer, paralyzed by fear of wrong choice |
| 4 | 6+ months looking, several "almost" offers backed out, chronic second-guessing |
| 3 | Multiple months looking, difficulty narrowing options, "what if" mentality |
| 2 | Normal deliberation, wants to be thorough but making progress |
| 1 | Decisive, clear decision-making process |

### Strong Negative Examples
> **Score 5**: "We've been looking for about 18 months now. We've seen probably 50 houses but nothing feels quite right. We just want to make sure we don't make a mistake."

> **Score 4**: "We almost made an offer twice but pulled back at the last minute. What if something better comes along?"

## 3. External Blockers (`external_blockers`)

### Definition
Buyer faces external circumstances that prevent or significantly delay purchase.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Pending sale of current home that must close first
- [ ] Legal issues (divorce, estate settlement, pending lawsuit)
- [ ] Family disagreement or absent decision-maker with different views

### Scoring Rubric (Severity)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Blocker is immovable and indefinite (contested divorce, legal dispute) |
| 4 | Significant blocker with uncertain timeline (home sale in difficult market) |
| 3 | Blocker exists but has reasonable path to resolution |
| 2 | Minor external dependency with clear timeline |
| 1 | No external blockers identified |

### Strong Negative Examples
> **Score 5**: "We're in the middle of a divorce and nothing is settled yet. It could be another year before we know what we can afford."

> **Score 4**: "We need to sell our current house first, but it's been on the market for 4 months with no offers."

---

## 4. Unrealistic Expectations (`unrealistic_expectations`)

### Definition
Buyer's expectations for price, features, or market conditions are misaligned with reality.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Wants significantly more than budget allows (champagne taste, beer budget)
- [ ] Expects market conditions that don't exist (2019 prices in 2024 market)
- [ ] Requires unicorn property (all must-haves that rarely exist together)

### Scoring Rubric (Severity)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Completely unrealistic, refuses to accept market reality, will never find what they want at their price |
| 4 | Significantly misaligned, needs major expectation reset, may become frustrated and quit |
| 3 | Some unrealistic elements but coachable, needs education |
| 2 | Slightly optimistic but reasonable, minor calibration needed |
| 1 | Realistic expectations aligned with market |

### Strong Negative Examples
> **Score 5**: "We want a 5-bedroom house with a pool, new construction, in the best school district, and our budget is $350k. That's what houses cost, right?"

> **Score 4**: "I don't understand why houses are so expensive now. We should be able to get what we want for what we paid 10 years ago."

---

## 5. Competitor Preference (`competitor_preference`)

### Definition
Buyer indicates preference for competing properties or agents, reducing likelihood of this deal closing.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)

| 4 | Strong preference for competitor property, seriously considering it |
| 3 | Comparing multiple options including strong competitor |
| 2 | Casually looking at other options, no strong preference elsewhere |
| 1 | Focused on current property/agent, no competitor interest |

### Strong Negative Examples
> **Score 5**: "Actually, we put an offer in on the house on Maple Street this morning. We're just waiting to hear back."

> **Score 4**: "The house we saw yesterday with the other agent is really our top choice. This one would be our backup."

| 2 | Normal life interference, still engaged when available |
