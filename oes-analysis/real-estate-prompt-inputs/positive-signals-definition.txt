## Purpose
Identify and score positive buying signals that indicate a prospect's likelihood to purchase.

---

## 1. Financial Readiness (`financial_readiness`)

### Definition
Buyer demonstrates clear financial preparation and capability to complete a purchase.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Mentions pre-approval, mortgage approval, or specific lender
- [ ] States specific budget with confidence (not "around" or "maybe")
- [ ] References deposit/down payment availability or proof of funds

### Scoring Rubric
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Pre-approved with letter in hand, cash buyer, or deposit ready. Specific numbers mentioned. |
| 4 | Pre-approval in progress with specific lender, clear budget with some flexibility stated |
| 3 | Has spoken to lender, general budget range established, knows approximate down payment |
| 2 | Vague budget ("around $X"), hasn't started financing conversation, unsure about down payment |
| 1 | No financial discussion, unclear ability to purchase, avoids money questions |

### Strong Signal Examples
> **Score 5**: "We got our pre-approval last week for $750k from Chase, and we have 20% ready to go in our savings account."

> **Score 5**: "We're cash buyers - we sold our business last year and we're ready to move."

> **Score 4**: "We're working with a mortgage broker right now, should have pre-approval by Friday. Looking in the $600-650k range."

### Weak Signal Examples
> **Score 2**: "We're probably looking around $500k, maybe $600k if we really love it. Haven't talked to a bank yet."

> **Score 1**: "We're not sure about budget yet, we need to figure out what we can afford."

## 2. Timeline Urgency (`timeline_urgency`)

- [ ] Expresses urgency language ("need to", "have to", "must", "deadline")
- [ ] References life event driving timeline (baby, marriage, divorce, relocation, retirement)

### Scoring Rubric
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Hard deadline within 30 days with specific date. External pressure is immovable. |

> **Score 4**: "We're expecting our first baby in April, so we'd really like to be settled before then."

### Weak Signal Examples

## 3. Decision Maker Engagement (`decision_maker_engagement`)

### Definition
All key decision makers are actively involved in the buying process, reducing risk of deal falling through due to absent stakeholder.

### Checklist Conditions (require 2 of 3)
- [ ] Both partners/spouses present or explicitly aligned ("my husband agrees", "we both want")

### Strong Signal Examples
> **Score 5**: "My wife and I are both here today. We've talked about this a lot and we're ready to find our home."

> **Score 5**: "I'm buying this myself - it's just me, so I can make decisions quickly."

> **Score 4**: "My husband couldn't make it today but I showed him the listing and he loves it. We're on the same page."

### Weak Signal Examples
> **Score 2**: "I'm looking for my parents, they asked me to check out some places for them."

> **Score 1**: "My wife doesn't know I'm here yet, I want to surprise her."

## 4. Property Specificity (`property_specificity`)

### Definition

> **Score 1**: "We're open to anything really, just want to see what's available."
